This is where I throw in .NET helpers and extensions that I've used or will use in other projects.

My goal is to keep them completely separate from each other (including overloads, private methods, etc.), so that there are no dependencies between them. The only big downside of all this is the possibility of duplicate code.

Not all methods are fully tested yet.  :-)
